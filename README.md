# SQL_Danny's_Diner

In this SQL project, I have analysed the data from a restaurant called Danny's Diner and answered questions by drawing insights regarding the visiting pattern of customers, how much money theyâ€™ve spent, which menu items are their favourite and several other questions that would help the business owner in further scaling up his venture.

It is crucial for any small business owner to have a deep connection with his/her customers as it would further help them in delivering a better and more personalised experience for the loyal customers.

Further, these insights would help the business owner decide whether he/she should expand the existing customer loyalty program before investing further into the venture.

I have used MS-SQL Server and created the database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis. 

The datasets used for the analysis can be viewed on the below website:
